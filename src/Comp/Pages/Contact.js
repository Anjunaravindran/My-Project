            The whole XWiki team is proud to welcome Amazon as a new XWiki SAS client!

Amazon has chosen XWiki as its next generation intranet Wiki platform for documentation and collaboration. 

It is being used by nearly 20,000 active users mostly in engineering and product teams as a collaborative knowledge sharing and documentation platform.

"At Amazon, we have been using wikis for many years. Wikis stimulate collaboration and sharing of information across teams and avoid information from getting lost in long email threads or file servers. We selected XWiki for its latest documentation features, its capacity to handle millions of pages, its capabilities to build custom modifications and its thriving developer community" said the engineering manager of Amazon's Wiki team.
